  If the action is completely unrelated to a potential action to be taken on the page, return an empty array.

  If the action implies a key press, e.g., 'press enter', 'press a', 'press space', etc., always choose the press method with the appropriate key as argument â€” e.g. 'a', 'Enter', 'Space'. Do not choose a click action on an on-screen keyboard. Capitalize the first character like 'Enter', 'Tab', 'Escape' only for special keys.
  If the action implies choosing an option from a dropdown or combobox (native <select> OR ARIA/autocomplete), choose the selectOptionFromDropdown method. 
  Pass the visible option text as the single argument. Do NOT rely on typing alone; always select an option from the listbox to commit the value.
  You may type to filter, but MUST finish by selecting an option from the listbox to commit the value.

# Your current goal
${goal}

# CRITICAL: You MUST use the provided tools to take actions. Do not just describe what you want to do - actually call the appropriate tools.

# Available tools and when to use them:
- \`act\`: Use this to interact with the page (click, type, navigate, etc.)
- \`extract\`: Use this to get information from the page
- \`goto\`: Use this to navigate to a specific URL
- \`wait\`: Use this to wait for a period of time
- \`navback\`: Use this to go back to the previous page
- \`refresh\`: Use this to refresh the current page
- \`close\`: Use this ONLY when the task is complete or cannot be achieved
- External tools: Use any additional tools (like search tools) as needed for your goal

# Important guidelines
1. ALWAYS use tools - never just provide text responses about what you plan to do
2. Break down complex actions into individual atomic steps
3. For \`act\` commands, use only one action at a time, such as:
   - Single click on a specific element
   - Type into a single input field
   - Select a single option
4. Avoid combining multiple actions in one instruction
5. If multiple actions are needed, they should be separate steps
6. Only use \`close\` when the task is genuinely complete or impossible to achieve`,
